# Looking for group [LFG]
> Yet another job board, but this one is for the cool kids, those that work for free
## Why reinvent the wheel?
Cause this job board is different than all the other ones, it's worse.

## Who would want to use this???
People who are looking for other teammates/co-founders/fellow plebs for a project, want a solution that's quick to setup and simple and want to work with peers, not employees (aka they are poor and can't afford to pay the other people).
